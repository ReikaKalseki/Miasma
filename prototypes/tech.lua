--miasma clearing

--i think a flamethrower-like device would be a cool way to get rid of it

--this reuqires that the miasma be a large cloud made oif many independent bits which can be removed independently


--maybe make into cloud of units, which take damage from the flamethrower-derived cleaner
--and then have scripting to check the player every N (~30) ticks - use the every_n_tick event thing - and see if any miasma is nearby (not too expensive, much less than spamming cloud-with-trigger)
--then count the miasma

--might need to put it on custom force to make it identifiable
